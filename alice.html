    <p class="bioText">Alice has been gaming since she was old enough to hold a controller and grew up in a house of gamers. Her favorite game genre is RPGs and she's played most all consoles, except some newer ones. Her first online game was Ragnorok online (Xilero server) as Starlit. From there she played WoW as Alice for many years (up to Cataclysm) and various other MMORPGs. She also plays a lot of League of Legends as Kirsteen, but is forever a silver player <i class="far fa-grin-tongue fa-lg"></i> It's through LoL that she met most of her fellow G.O.Ds. and is part of the Clash team. Alice is also an artist and special effects makeup artist. She combines her artistic talents with her hobby of mermaiding and runs a shop called The Sunken Armory. The shop sells silicone accessories for merfolk and water creatures. During the Holloween season she creates monsters for a local haunt and runs around scaring people as a demon. She recently got into D&D and plays across multiple campaigns on the G.O.D.S.'s server. Her first campaign was AcrobaticAdmiral's Curse of Strahd campaign where she played a druid named Arysia Nightshade. When she's not gaming or creating something you can probably find her bullshitting with fellow G.O.Ds in her spider den.</p>
